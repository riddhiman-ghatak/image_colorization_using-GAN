cGANs Colorisation of black&amp;white Images



---

We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a
general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation
problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from
input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply
the same generic approach to problems that traditionally
would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos
from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps,
and colorizing images, among other tasks.
